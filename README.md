Linear Regression Assignment

The Assignment aims to model the demand for shared bikes in the American market post the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. The goal is to identify significant variables that affect bike demand and create a predictive model to understand demand dynamics based on these factors. This model will assist BoomBikes' management in strategizing their business operations to meet customer demand effectively and stand out in the market.

General Information
The background of the project lies in BoomBikes' response to the significant revenue declines experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a bike-sharing service provider, they recognize the need to adapt their business strategy to meet the changing demands of the market post-lockdown. By understanding the factors influencing bike demand, BoomBikes aims to develop a predictive model that can effectively forecast demand levels based on various independent variables.
BoomBikes has experienced significant revenue dips as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures. With people staying indoors and adhering to social distancing guidelines, the demand for shared bikes has plummeted.To effectively respond to changing market conditions and meet customer expectations, BoomBikes needs to understand the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. By identifying significant variables that drive bike demand, such as weather conditions, day of the week, holidays, etc., BoomBikes can develop a predictive model to forecast demand levels accurately.
The dataset provides comprehensive information about various factors that may influence the demand for shared bikes, such as weather conditions, day of the week, holidays, and temperature. The cnt column serves as the target variable, representing the total number of rental bikes on a given day. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify significant variables that affect bike demand and build a predictive model to forecast demand levels accurately.


Conclusions
Assignment covers descriptive statistics for various numerical variables, offering insights into the distribution and characteristics of the dataset. It also presents the dimensions of the training and testing sets, along with the R-squared score as a measure of model performance. These findings are crucial for understanding the dataset's properties and assessing the predictive capability of the model.
